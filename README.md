# Clash Royale Deck Suggestions

First iteration of Clash Royale personal project. Abandoned because inefficient use of API calls -> I hit the rate limit on Heroku's free plan very quickly. See cr-decks-api for second iteration.

## Tools
React, Heroku

## Details

The website uses the Clash Royale API (developer.clashroyale.com) to retrieve the current top 100 players in the world and their deck selections. Then, using a simple matching algorithm, the website ranks the decks based on how effectively the user would be able to use it. You can find a video demo at https://youtu.be/jbWa_X3HyBY.
